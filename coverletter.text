Hiring Manager
Nintendo Software Technology Corporation
Redmond, WA

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Graphics Software Engineer I position at Nintendo Software Technology Corporation. With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Western Washington University and hands-on experience in graphics development and game programming, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your engineering department and help create the exceptional games Nintendo is known for.

During my academic and professional experience, I have developed a solid foundation in C++, OpenGL, and shader programming, as well as experience with various graphics programming APIs such as Vulkan and DirectX. My work on an OpenGL renderer project, where I wrote shaders to simulate dynamic lighting and applied the Blinn-Phong model to multiple 3D objects, highlights my ability to write, test, and debug complex graphics code. Additionally, my experience developing 3D action puzzle games in Unity, collaborating with team members, and creating enemy AI and combat behaviors, has strengthened my problem-solving and teamwork skills—qualities I would bring to your team at Nintendo.

Nintendo’s emphasis on delivering high-quality games and fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment strongly aligns with my values. As a former Aviation Electronics Technician in the United States Navy, I learned to work in high-pressure environments, troubleshoot complex systems, and ensure tasks are completed to the highest standards. I look forward to applying these skills to the development of cutting-edge tools and engines, while contributing to your mission of surprising and delighting players around the world.

I would love the opportunity to further discuss how my technical skills, creativity, and passion for game development can support Nintendo Software Technology’s goals. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
David Jenson
